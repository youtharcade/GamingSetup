# Mission
To try and document all the things I'm doing with my Apple Network to allow for gaming throughout the house. This has been a constant mission to try and ease gaming throughout my house no matter what the computer. I have gotten closer than ever before now and so I decided to take this opportunity to try and note anything of interest. This is a companion piece to my AppleNetworkSetup github documentation and you can go there to see the full list of hardware/software used for this network.
